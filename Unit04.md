-   **Unit 4: Introductory Design Project**  

    *In this unit, you will demonstrate creative, quantitative, and
    critical thinking in the design of a solution to an engineering
    problem of your choice.  The steps given below are small subset of
    what is typically advocated for serious design, but the process
    should give you a flavor of design and allow you to show some
    creativity.*

    **Unit 4 Time Advisory**  

    This unit will take you approximately 26 hours to complete.  
       
     ☐    Subunit 4.1: 6 hours  
       
     ☐    Subunit 4.2: 8 hours  
       
     ☐    Subunit 4.3: 12 hours

    **Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  

    Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:

    -   demonstrate an understanding of the design process;
    -   use quantitative tools to characterize a design;
    -   effectively communicate a design with engineering drawings; and
    -   consider ethical and social factors in design.

-   **4.2 Choose and Define a Project**  

    *Note: For this subunit you need to choose and define a design
    project.  By define, we mean set some parameters for the scope of
    the project.  For example, you may want to explicitly name and
    explain your project's purpose, minimum functionality, cost,
    lifetime, and so forth.  Some examples of suitable project topics
    may be found in the link below.  In defining the project, you should
    obtain ideas and recommendations by interviewing at least five other
    people.  Summarize your project definition in a one page statement.*
