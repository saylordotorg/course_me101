-   **Unit 3: Introduction to Engineering Computations**  

    *In this unit you will how to perform some basic engineering
    computations using the freely available software Scilab.  This tool
    is similar to many other computational software commonly used by
    engineers, so the skills learned here will be applicable to other
    professional situations you may encounter.*  
       
     *You will learn the software here by performing several examples
    which allow you to employ specific syntax or grammar.  If you
    perform enough of these examples, you may internalize that grammar
    (or way of computational thinking). You will specifically look at
    data entry, arithmetic manipulations, data display, equation
    solving, and matrix manipulations.*  
       
     *This unit is an introduction to computation.  More thorough
    coverage is available within The Saylor Foundation’s* [ME205:
    Numerical Methods for
    Engineers](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me205/).

        Instructions: Please download the latest version of Scilab
        appropriate to your machine from Scilab.org. If you have
        difficulty navigating that site you may use the versions of
        Scilab hosted by Saylor that are listed above. To do so, please
        click on the appropriate download link for your computer system.
         After the file downloads, simply activate that file and follow
        the instructions.  **You may have to rename the file to make it
        easily executable**.  Several libraries will be downloaded
        during the installation process, so you will need to maintain
        Internet connectivity during the installation.
