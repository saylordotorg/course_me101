Course Syllabus for "ME101: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering"
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the field of mechanical engineering
and the relationships between physics, mathematics, communications, and
sciences which inform the study, design, and manufacture of mechanical
products and systems.  The course is divided into four units.  In the
first unit, you will learn how mechanical engineering is broadly
defined, what mechanical engineers do, and what technical capabilities
they have.  We will also review some basic principles from mathematics
and physics that you will apply in any discipline of engineering.  In
the second unit, you will learn about the ethical considerations and
technical communication skills necessary for engineering work.  You will
revisit these issues in more detail in several courses within the
Mechanical Engineering curriculum.  The third unit focuses on
computational tools for engineering problems.  In Unit 3 you will learn
about a specific open source computational environment (Scilab) and the
application of that environment to some commonly encountered engineering
problems.  Finally, in the fourth unit, you will apply some of the
concepts you learned throughout the course to a small design project
that employs mechanical engineering principles.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   define mechanical engineering;
-   describe some of the subfields of mechanical engineering;
-   distinguish mechanical engineering from other types of engineering;
-   describe important components of engineering design and project
    management;
-   employ engineering measurements, units, and conversions;
-   demonstrate an understanding of engineering ethics and ethical
    dilemmas;
-   describe intellectual property and copyright issues in an
    engineering context;
-   perform basic oral and written technical communication according to
    the accepted standards of the mechanical engineering community;
-   perform several basic computations in Scilab, including matrix
    manipulations and nonlinear equation solving;
-   perform data analysis and display using Scilab; and
-   demonstrate an understanding of all of the above through execution
    of an engineering design project.

### Course Information

Welcome to **ME101 Introduction to Mechanical Engineering**.  Below,
please find general information on this course and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designers: **Ranjeet (Ron) Agarwala and [Dr. Steve
Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Peer Reviewer:** Stephen Gibbs  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of free,
online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Johns Hopkins University: [“What Is
    Engineering?”](http://www.jhu.edu/virtlab/index.html)
-   Michigan Technological University: [“What Is Mechanical
    Engineering?”](http://www.me.mtu.edu/admin/whatme.html#what)
-   Pennsylvania State University: The National Society of Professional
    Ethics' [“Code of Ethics for
    Engineers”](http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/CodeofEthics/index.html)
-   University of Virginia: Darden School of Business’ [“Intellectual
    Property: Patents, Trademarks, and
    Copyright”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFRaamWjYGo)
-   Scilab.org: [“Introduction to
    Scilab”](http://www.scilab.org/support/documentation/tutorials)
-   Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Ernesto E. Blanco, David
    Gordon Wilson, Sherondalyn Johnson, and LaTaunynia
    Flemings' [“Engineering Drawing and
    Sketching”](http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me2011/handouts/drawing/blanco-tutorial.html)
-   American Society of Mechanical Engineers: [“Integrated Design
    Engineering Activity Series
    (IDEAS)”](http://www.asme.org/groups/educational-resources/integrated-design-engineering-activity-series)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
This course will let you assess your interest in and aptitude for the
field of mechanical engineering.  You will have the opportunity to
survey problem areas for which expertise in mechanical engineering is
valuable, learn some of the fundamentals of engineering calculations,
and perform design activities for problem solving.  As you study
mechanical engineering, this course may help you focus your attention on
areas in which you need additional background review and in specific
areas in which you may have some enthusiasm for learning more.  
   
 In order to pass this course, you will need to complete the final exam
with a score of at least 70%.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated
as soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take
it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** You should be able to complete this course in
approximately **106.5 hours**.  Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then to set goals
for yourself.    
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** (1) Get into a routine for studying the material
and do a little each day.  (2) Unit 1 requires extensive calculations,
so you may want to learn to make sketches of the situations involved.
 (3) Unit 3 requires reading detailed material.  Dedication to and
substantial practice of this material will likely benefit your later
studies within the Mechanical Engineering curriculum.  Skim through all
material first for scope, and then read for a more detailed
understanding.  You may wish to revisit the complex parts several times
after completing the course.  
    
 We encourage you to also take notes as you work through the course
materials.  These notes will be useful as you prepare for the final
exam.
