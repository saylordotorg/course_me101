-   **Unit 1: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering**  

    *The first unit of this course will allow you to take a close look
    at the mechanical engineering profession and learn about what
    differentiates it from other technical fields.  We will examine what
    engineers—specifically, mechanical engineers—contribute to the
    workforce.  You will also learn about the areas in which engineers
    can work or contribute professionally.*  
       
     *We will then take a look at the design side of the engineering
    profession.  Many look upon this as the “core” element of
    engineering.  You will learn about project management and identify
    ways to successfully contribute to a group effort.  This unit will
    also explain the product design process, an essential element in
    mechanical engineering.  This unit will also cover professional
    ethics and oral and written communication.  You will use many of
    these skills in the final unit of this course and in several
    subsequent courses in the curriculum.*

    **Unit 1 Time Advisory**  

    This unit will take you approximately 11.25 hours to complete.
