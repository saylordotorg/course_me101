-   **Unit 2: Ethics and Communication**  

    *This section introduces two vital matters that you will encounter
    in any engineering project: ethics and communication.  As a
    mechanical engineer, you should be able to evaluate all aspects of
    your project and understand how it will impact society and the
    environment.  Many times, engineers are put into difficult ethical
    situations when they must make product design and manufacturing
    decisions.  When faced with one of these controversial situations,
    you should know how to make the most ethically sound choice.*  
       
     *Engineers must also know how to communicate to justify their
    decisions and project findings to their audiences, whomever they may
    include.  This means that you must be able to decipher technical
    jargon so that someone who is unfamiliar with your area of expertise
    can still understand the impact of your completed project. 
    Miscommunication can have harmful or even devastating impacts; it is
    therefore imperative that you minimize its occurrence.  This unit
    will cover common technical documents, writing techniques, and
    presentation tactics that can help you become a confident and
    valuable communicator.*

         Instructions: Please click on the link above and view the
        entire video (9:33), which describes how case studies are used
        in engineering technology to teach ethics.  It is important for
        you to understand how each decision you make during your
        engineering career can have future implications.  For example,
        cutting corners to save the company money may seem like a good
        idea at the moment, but this decision can have devastating
        consequences further down the line.  While there is no
        definitive “right answer” when it comes to ethical matters, you
        should learn how to take steps that will exhibit your integrity
        and care for the well-being of the general public.
